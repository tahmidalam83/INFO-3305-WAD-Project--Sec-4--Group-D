Challenges while developing the application


1.	Lack of resources was a main issue for us. We could hardly integrate all the resources but yet we tried our level best. 


3.	All of the group members are not experienced in Laravel. Every one of us is first time user for Laravel application building. That’s why the journey was not easy.


5.	The time duration was a bit short for the first time Laravel application builders and for us it takes long time to make a good project. But Alhamdulillah we have done our best. 


7.	Online classes have made the communication among the group members tougher. It would be great if we could complete the project communicating in person. 


9.	The knowledge of Laravel has to be explored more so that we can make better projects in future.
